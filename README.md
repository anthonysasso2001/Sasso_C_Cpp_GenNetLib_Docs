# Introduction

Separate documentations for Sasso_C_Cpp_GenNetLib intended to be
included as a submodule or similar to help segregate the code better.

# Getting Started

## Software Dependencies

1. Ensure a Text editor like LaTeX or LibreOffice, as well as Some
    Visualization Program like LibreOffice Draw or Inkscape to allow a
    unified, accessible format for the documentation Source.

# Build & Test

1. Download / Clone Target Branch (by default would recommend the
    latest one).

2. Modify the appropriate documentation file, adding separate
    documentation as needed.

3. Review Spelling, format, (if applicable) convert to a PDF, SVG, or
    PNG version.

4. Commit code according to contribute steps below.

\*Please note all documentation should include the footer
**"Documentation licensed under CC-BY-4.0, code & software examples
licensed under GNU GPLv3."** for clarification, in the case of
visualizations this may be included by a floating box in the corner of
the display. Easiest way for TeX documents is to copy this README's code
from % footer, to end of \\fancyfoot\[C\] (lines 10-18).

# Contribute

To Contribute to the project follow these rules:

- First create an issue / feature request notifying any changes that
  are wanted.

- Wait to hear the initial response / accepting of that issue before
  you begin coding.

- Fork or Branch (dependent on scope, membership in core development
  team, etc.) the repo and code any necessary fixed to fulfill this
  new feature / fix the bug.

- Issue a pull request back to the main repo with your latest released
  version and attach a text file or description within the pull
  request detailing your changes, additions, considerations with this
  pull request. In addition, follow the "LatexToMarkdownNoted.md"
  within the ".README" Source folder to update the README listing any
  necessary changes, and have this as your final commit before the
  pull request.
